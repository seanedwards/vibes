# Welcome Demo

**Start here:** Read about how this demo was created by viewing [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/seanedwards/vibes/issues/5).

## What is this?

This is a simple Hello World application written in Ruby as part of a proof of concept demonstration of Claude Code GitHub Actions. The entire demo - including this README, the Ruby script, and the project structure - was created through AI assistance in response to a GitHub issue.

## Running the Demo

To run the Hello World application:

```bash
ruby hello.rb
```

Or, provide your name as an argument for a personalized greeting:

```bash
ruby hello.rb "Your Name"
```

This will output a friendly greeting message to demonstrate that the Ruby script is working correctly. If no name is provided, it defaults to "World".
