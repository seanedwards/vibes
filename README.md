# Vibes: AI Coding Tool Experiments

Welcome to the Vibes project! This repository serves as a collection of experiments that I've run using AI coding tools, particularly focusing on testing and validating Claude Code GitHub Actions functionality.

## What is this project?

This is a test bench repository for exploring AI-powered automation in GitHub workflows through Claude Code Actions. The project demonstrates how AI can be used to:

- Create complete pull requests from issue descriptions
- Implement features and fix bugs automatically
- Follow project standards and coding conventions
- Provide implementation guidance and code reviews

## Getting Started

To see how this process works, start by reading [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/seanedwards/vibes/issues/5) which demonstrates the creation of this very README file and a welcome demo using AI assistance.

## Project Structure

The root of this project contains subfolders for each experiment, named using the format `YYYY-MM-DD Experiment Name/`. Each experiment showcases different aspects of AI-powered development workflows.

## About Claude Code GitHub Actions

Claude Code GitHub Actions enables AI-powered automation in GitHub workflows through simple `@claude` mentions in PRs and issues. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of these capabilities in action.
